# ERA5-Downloader
A JUBE [http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Support/Software/JUBE/JUBE2/_node.html] script for downloading the full ERA5 dataset from Copernicus [http://www.copernicus.eu]. Note that this might take several months and it WILL outrun your computer's memory and hard drive, many many times. A supercomputer is required.
